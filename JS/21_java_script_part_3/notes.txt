String Methods:
--------------
Methods- actions that can be performed on objects.

Format:
stringName.Method()

so basically the we can identified a method by paranthsis() for an example we have used console.log() here log() is a method which prints in the console. Same as alert(), error() all this are Methods

let str = "Apple"
str.abc() //here abc is a method

Trim method:
------------
let msg = "   Hello  "

str.trim()
Trims whitespaces from both ends of string & returns a new one.
    msg.trim();
    'Hello'
    msg
    '   Hello  '
output: "Hello", but value of msg remains same.

note:  in Javascript the strings are called as immuteable

String are Immutable in JS:
---------------------------
No changes can be made to strings.
Whenever we do try to make a change, a new string is created and old one remains same.

-> let str = "Random string";
-> str.toUpperCase()  "RANDOM STRING"
-> str.toLowerCase()  "random string"

note: don't forget to give paranthsis

String Methods with Arguments:
------------------------------
Argument is a some value that we pass to the method.
Format
StringName.method(arg)

indexOf:
--------
Returns the first index of occureance of some value in string. Or gives -1 if not found.

let str = "IloveCoding";
           012345678910
str.indexOf("love")   //1
str.inexOf("J")       //-1 (not found)
str.indexOf("o")      //2(only 1 index)

basically we are performing index search
